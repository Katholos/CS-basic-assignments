//Matt Raetano
//Write a Java application program that will create and display a very simple word find puzzle.
//Begin by asking the user to enter three-letter word, a four-letter word, a five-letter word and another four-letter word (in that order!). Store each word in a separate String variable.
//Once the user has entered all four items, use the appropriate String method to change the user's items to all uppercase letters.
//Next create the word find puzzle according to the following rules:
//Add the letters "WQTLK" to the beginning of the first word.
//Add the letters "RXM" to the beginning of the second word.
//Add the letter "P" to the end of the second word.
//Add the letter "F" to the beginning of the third word.
//Add the letters "MB" to the end of the third word.
//Add the letters "QYLA" to the end of the fourth word.
//Once the entire puzzle has been assembled, display the puzzle to the screen.
